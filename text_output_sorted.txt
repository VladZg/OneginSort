СОБСТВЕННАЯ СОРТИРОВКА (прямой порядок):

A mild rebuke was his worst mark,
After a fine career, his father
And bred upon the Neva's brink,
And glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And never played a shrewder trick.
And never stir a foot away!
And sighs, and asks oneself all through:
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
And then a stroll in Letny Park.
As horses whirled him through the dust.
At first Madame gave him tuition,
But God, how deadly dull to sample
But I'm allergic to the North...
But when past joking he fell sick,
By will of Zeus, the high and just,
Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
From her Monsieur took on the child.
Had only debts on which to live.
He gave three balls a year, and rather
He really forced one to admire him --
He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
Let me acquaint you on the nail
Let others learn from his example!
Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
No moralizing from this joker;
Of entertaining the half-dead:
One smoothes the pillows down in bed,
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
Promptly had nothing left to give.
Reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
Reluctant to exhaust the boy,
Sickroom attendance night and day
Such were a young rake's meditations --
The legatee of his relations --
There once I too strolled back and forth:
Treated his lessons as a ploy.
"When will the devil come for you?"''
With this the hero of my tale:
Without preliminary feeler
where you were born as well, I think,

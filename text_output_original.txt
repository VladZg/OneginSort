ОРИГИНАЛЬНЫЙ ТЕКСТ:
======================================================================
``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
But when past joking he fell sick,
He really forced one to admire him --
And never played a shrewder trick.
Let others learn from his example!
But God, how deadly dull to sample
Sickroom attendance night and day
And never stir a foot away!
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
Of entertaining the half-dead:
One smoothes the pillows down in bed,
And glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And sighs, and asks oneself all through:
"When will the devil come for you?"''
Such were a young rake's meditations --
By will of Zeus, the high and just,
The legatee of his relations --
As horses whirled him through the dust.
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
Without preliminary feeler
Let me acquaint you on the nail
With this the hero of my tale:
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
And bred upon the Neva's brink,
where you were born as well, I think,
Reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
There once I too strolled back and forth:
But I'm allergic to the North...
After a fine career, his father
Had only debts on which to live.
He gave three balls a year, and rather
Promptly had nothing left to give.
Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
At first Madame gave him tuition,
From her Monsieur took on the child.
He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
Reluctant to exhaust the boy,
Treated his lessons as a ploy.
No moralizing from this joker;
A mild rebuke was his worst mark,
And then a stroll in Letny Park.

СОБСТВЕННАЯ СОРТИРОВКА (прямой порядок):
======================================================================

And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
But God, how deadly dull to sample
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
Let others learn from his example!
My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
Such were a young rake's meditations --
There once I too strolled back and forth:
"When will the devil come for you?"
and bred upon the Neva's brink,
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
and never played a shrewder trick.
and never stir a foot away!
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
as horses whirled him through the dust.
but I'm allergic to the North...
but when past joking he fell sick,
by will of Zeus, the high and just,
he really forced one to admire him --
let me acquaint you on the nail
of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
sickroom attendance night and day
the legatee of his relations --
where you were born as well, I think,
with this the hero of my tale:
without preliminary feeler
